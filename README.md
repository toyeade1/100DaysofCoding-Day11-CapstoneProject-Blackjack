# 100DaysofCoding-Day11-CapstoneProject-Blackjack

For this capstone project, we were tasked with creating a blackjack game that adhered to all of the rules and it would incoroprate most of what we had learned so far. It was really interesting and forced me to think about every action the computer would do as it went through my program in order to effectively debug it. 

All in all I am really happy with the way the project turned out. I tried a version where i did not use any of the hints and while i got far, I didnt completely solve the game, usinh the hints, i then created another program which i belive fufills the purpose of the game to its fullest extent, along with the option to restart the game again using recursion.
